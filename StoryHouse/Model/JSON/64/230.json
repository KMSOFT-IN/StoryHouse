Mango was different from all the other monkeys in the savanna, for he had a special talent - he could talk to animals.

The wand was made of a shimmering golden material and had intricate designs carved into it. Mango picked it up and examined it closely. Suddenly, the wand began to glow and a soft voice whispered in his ear, 'I am a magical wand, and I can grant you three wishes.'",

He flew over the savanna, seeing all the animals from a new perspective. He flew over the lions, waving to them as they roared below him. He flew over the elephants, who looked up in awe at the flying monkey.",
